# NEXWorld

NEXWorld is a NEWorld implemention, licensed under WTFPL v2!
This was created for testing another program structure (different from NEWorld's) for Minecraft-like games...

### Compilation
*Not yet complete*

Dependencies include glew, sdl2, sdl2-image, freetype.
If you're using Visual Studio, it's recommended to use vcpkg to download the dependencies, or you can put headers into directory `/include`, static libraries into `/lib` or `/lib64` for x86 and x64 configuration respectively.
